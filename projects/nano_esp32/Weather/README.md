# Weather station

I built a temperature monitoring system using an Arduino Nano ESP32, DHT11 sensor, and 4 LEDs. The system reads temperature and humidity data and displays the temperature range visually through color-coded LEDs: blue for cold (≤19°C), green for cozy (20-23°C), yellow for warm (24-27°C), and red for hot (>27°C). The circuit is powered by a breadboard power supply module connected to a 9V battery, making it portable and independent from USB power.

**Components**:
- Arduino Nano ESP32
- 4 LEDs (red, yellow, green and blue)
- 4 resistors (3x 220 Ohms, 1x 100 Ohms)
- DHT11 sensor
- Breadboard power supply module
- 9v Battery
